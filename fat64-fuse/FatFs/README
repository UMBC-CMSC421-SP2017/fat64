This is FatFs R0.11a by ChaN. You can find the original code at the following
URL: http://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/00index_e.html

FatFs is a module for building applications that access FAT filesystems. It is
designed primarily for use on small microcontrollers, but is written in standard
ANSI C (C89) and should work on just about any platform. It is licensed under
very permissive licensing terms. Please see the ff.c file in the src directory
for information on the licensing terms.

FatFs is provided for your project to give you a base for working with FAT
filesystems. It will have to be adapted for use with FAT64 if you wish to use
it in your project. In addition, you will have to write glue code to support
using this code with FUSE.
